## Lecture Introduction
- All projects and assignments are based on **'2024 Fall Artificial Intelligence(n)'** by KNU P4C Lab.
- This lecture is technically about Game Playing AI with Deep Learning, different curriculum I took at [**"22 Fall**](https://github.com/liebenholz/2022-2_AI).
- I've been taking this course as an auditor.
